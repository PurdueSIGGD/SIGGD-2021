# SIGGD-Unity-Template
Template for creating new Unity GitHub repositories.
How to setup:
  1) Click the "Use this template" button to make your own duplicate repository on GitHub
  2) Download and setup the new reposotory to your computer (Using GitHub Desktop is reccomended)
  3) Create a new Unity project in the repository folder
  4) Commit the changes to the Master branch
  5) The repository should now be ready for use

General use:
  1) Have members of your team each create branches for all new changes after this to avoid overwriting anyone's work
  2) Once something on a branch is "done" pull the latest branches from master into your own branch
  3) Check that your branch still works with the newest master changes
  4) Create a pull request from your branch into master
  5) These pull requests will be checked by one of the project leads and merged if able, if not, marge master into your own branch again and fix any conflicts
